Products in circleK probably use a linear, 1D barcode. The UPC type. I am
assuming that the barcodes correlate to a key which is lookedup in CircleK's POS
when items are scanned.
- What kind of information would be CircleK's DB? 
- Do we need to create our own DB of the product? 

We would need to be able to capture like a batch or lot number so that we know
which items correspond to which batch
