Hello, my name is Roh and I am a Frontend Engineer with 2 years of experience developing and deploying beautiful and responsive web applications using React and Typescript in the cloud. My background in Mechanical Engineering provide me the unique skillset to blend first-principles thinking from traditional engineering to the fast-paced modern development cycle of Software Engineering. Although I am based in Calgary, I am highly interested in moving out west to Vancouver. If you'd like to learn more about me and my background, please check out my personal web portfolio: https://rohineshram.com.

Also, in an effort to give back to the software community from whom I've learned a lot, I like writing articles. Here is an article I wrote about using Terraform to deploy single-page-applications to AWS:

I am currently writing an article to support my image and video cloud hosting application.

Thank you for reviewing my application,
