Adding zettelkasten system:
Literature Notes = comments to text you are reading
 - Book Title, Author, Chapter

Reference Notes = tags for your notes

Permanent Notes = stand-alone ideas that don't require context   
These are a recap or summary of information just researched or learned

 Fleeting Notes = pretty much a brain dump or random thoughts and ideas
 throughout the day

Steps:
1) write down thoughts and why you are taking notes of informations
2) Rewrite notes for the Zettelkasten
    - highlight key elements
    - include: Author's name, book, location, or link URL
    - highlight learning objectives or key pointsin a bullet list
3) Add a structure to Zettel
    - add links between zettels => categories, type of notes ??
    - Hub Notes = Zettels about a certain topic or Sub topic
4) Ask questions and review notes as a habit
