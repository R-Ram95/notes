Monitoring is the act of collecting, analyzing, and using data to make decisions or answer questions.

Metric / time = statistics

  

# Types of Metrics

Different services create different metics.

S3 → object sizes, # of objects, # of HTTP requests

RDS → DB connections, CPU usage, disk space

EC2 → cpu usage, network usage, disk performance, status checks

  

# Benefits to Monitoring

**Respond proactively:** response to operational issues before end users make you aware

**Improve perofmance and Reliability:** monitoring can show you bottlenecks

**Recognize Security Threats**: monitoring resources over-time helps you determine a baseline. If metrics deviate from the baseline, could be potential security issues.

**Make data driven decisions:** keep an eye on IT health to drive business decisions ⇒ think google analytics

**Create Cost effective solutions**: view resources that are underused or oversized.
