# aws-options-for-cheap-quick-database-deployment

For a proof-of-concept with AWS, here are some low-cost, quick-to-deploy options that integrate well with a Dockerized Express server:

1. **Amazon RDS with Free Tier Options**
   Database Options: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB.
   Benefits: Amazon RDS offers managed databases, so you don’t need to handle backups, maintenance, or scaling at this stage. The free tier includes 750 hours per month for db.t2.micro instances for the first year, plus some storage and I/O credits.
   Quick Setup: AWS Console has a guided setup for RDS, and you can quickly connect to it using your Dockerized Express app with minimal setup.
   Cost: Very low for initial development due to the free tier. Costs will scale if you need more storage or traffic but should remain manageable for a POC.
   
2. **Amazon Aurora Serverless v2**
   Database Options: Compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.
   Benefits: Aurora Serverless v2 offers scaling based on demand, which means you’re only charged for the resources you use. This can be especially cost-effective if the database usage is intermittent.
   Quick Setup: Easy to spin up via the RDS interface, and it’s designed to scale without manual intervention.
   Cost: Pricing depends on usage, making it ideal for variable loads. For a light POC, this option can be cheaper than traditional RDS instances, though it may be pricier than RDS free tier.

3. **SQLite with EFS (Elastic File System)**
   Setup: Run SQLite as a file-based database within your Docker container but mount the database file on an EFS volume for persistence.
   Benefits: Minimal setup and works well for small-scale testing without the need for RDS. EFS offers persistence, and you pay only for the storage you use.
   Cost: Costs are low, based on EFS usage rather than a full database instance. However, this may limit scalability and performance.

4. **Deploying PostgreSQL or MySQL Directly on an EC2 Instance**
   Setup: Spin up a small EC2 instance (e.g., t4g.micro, which is free for the first year with the AWS Free Tier for ARM instances) and install PostgreSQL or MySQL.
   Benefits: Full control over database configuration. Works well for a simple POC without the full overhead of RDS.
   Cost: Very low with free tier EC2, and you only pay for the storage used by the database (EBS).
   Each option balances control, ease of deployment, and cost differently. For a quick start, RDS with the free tier or Aurora Serverless might be the best options for flexibility and managed features.
